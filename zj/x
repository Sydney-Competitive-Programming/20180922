This is the worst kind of discrimination: the kind against me!
These old Doomsday Devices are dangerously unstable.
I'll rest easier not knowing where they are.
It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus.
All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV.
But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns.
Also he got a race car.
Is any of this getting through to you?
Yes!
In your face, Gandhi!
It's a T.
It goes "tuh".
There's one way and only one way to determine if an animal is intelligent.
Dissect its brain!
As an interesting side note, as a head without a body, I envy the dead.
You are the last hope of the universe.
That's the ONLY thing about being a slave.
That's not soon enough!
Hi, I'm a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to.
$9.95 a minute.
Why did you bring us here?
Kif, I have mated with a woman.
Inform the men.
Of all the friends I've had… you're the first.
Take me to your leader!
Yes, if you make it look like an electrical fire.
When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all.
Daddy Bender, we're hungry.
Bender, you risked your life to save me!
Yeah.
Give a little credit to our public schools.
Oh sure!
Blame the wizards!
Say it in Russian!
Pansy.
As an interesting side note, as a head without a body, I envy the dead.
I've been there.
My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants.
What am I, the pope?
A true inspiration for the children.
Check it out, y'all.
Everyone who was invited is here.
And why did 'I' have to take a cab?
Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance money!
Now Fry, it's been a few years since medical school, so remind me.
Disemboweling in your species: fatal or non-fatal?
Why did you bring us here?
Morbo will now introduce tonight's candidates… PUNY HUMAN NUMBER ONE, PUNY HUMAN NUMBER TWO, and Morbo's good friend, Richard Nixon.
I'll get my kit!
With gusto.
Bender, this is Fry's decision… and he made it wrong.
So it's time for us to interfere in his life.
Bender?!
You stole the atom.
Is the Space Pope reptilian!?
Bender, you risked your life to save me!
You guys realize you live in a sewer, right?
I found what I need.
And it's not friends, it's things.
Good news, everyone!
I've taught the toaster to feel love!
Stop it, stop it.
It's fine.
I will 'destroy' you!
Hey, whatcha watching?
That's right, baby.
I ain't your loverboy Flexo, the guy you love so much.
You even love anyone pretending to be him!
What are you hacking off?
Is it my torso?!
It is!
My precious torso!
Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them?
Bite my shiny metal ass.
For the last time, I don't like lilacs!
Your 'first' wife was the one who liked lilacs!
File not found.
Michelle, I don't regret this, but I both rue and lament it.
I haven't felt much of anything since my guinea pig died.
Good man.
Nixon's pro-war and pro-family.
Soon enough.
You guys aren't Santa!
You're not even robots.
How dare you lie in front of Jesus?
Bender, you risked your life to save me!
Please, Don-Bot… look into your hard drive, and open your mercy file!
Good news, everyone! I've taught the toaster to feel love!
Why, those are the Grunka-Lunkas!
They work here in the Slurm factory.
You can crush me but you can't crush my spirit!
Hello Morbo, how's the family?
And from now on you're all named Bender Jr.
I barely knew Philip, but as a clergyman I have no problem telling his most intimate friends all about him.
Ah, yes! John Quincy Adding Machine.
He struck a chord with the voters when he pledged not to go on a killing spree.
That's right, baby. I ain't your loverboy Flexo, the guy you love so much.
You even love anyone pretending to be him!
I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day.
I've been there.
My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants.
What am I, the pope? I love you, buddy!
Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes!
We have bigger problems.
I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept the lesser title of Zinc Saucier, which I just made up.
Uhh… also, comes with double prize money.
Also Zoidberg.
Stop!
Don't shoot fire stick in space canoe!
Cause explosive decompression!
Daylight and everything.
You wouldn't.
Ask anyway!
Alright, let's mafia things up a bit.
Joey, burn down the ship.
Clamps, burn down the crew.
It doesn't look so shiny to me.
Oh, how awful.
Did he at least die painlessly? To shreds, you say.
Well, how is his wife holding up?
To shreds, you say.
Why am I sticky and naked?
Did I miss something fun?
Too much work.
Let's burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer.
You won't have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making you'll be doing.
Ugh, it's filthy!
Why not create a National Endowment for Strip Clubs while we're at it?
Soothe us with sweet lies.
File not found.
But I've never been to the moon!
What are you hacking off?
Is it my torso?!
It is!
My precious torso!
Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged.
Dear God, they'll be killed on our doorstep!
And there's no trash pickup until January 3rd.
Now what?
Son, as your lawyer, I declare y'all are in a 12-piece bucket o' trouble.
But I done struck you a deal: Five hours of community service cleanin' up that ol' mess you caused.
Oh Leela!
You're the only person I could turn to; you're the only person who ever loved me.
You lived before you met me?!
Then throw her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred to as "the brig".
You know, I was God once.
Ugh, it's filthy!
Why not create a National Endowment for Strip Clubs while we're at it?
Look, everyone wants to be like Germany, but do we really have the pure strength of 'will'?
It must be wonderful.
Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance money!
The alien mothership is in orbit here.
If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards.
Checkmate.
Calculon is gonna kill us and it's all everybody else's fault!
You know the worst thing about being a slave?
They make you work, but they don't pay you or let you go.
Anyhoo, your net-suits will allow you to experience Fry's worm infested bowels as if you were actually wriggling through them.
Hey, what kinda party is this?
There's no booze and only one hooker.
Oh yeah, good luck with that.
Good news, everyone!
I've taught the toaster to feel love!
Oh, I always feared he might run off like this.
Why, why, why didn't I break his legs?
Oh right.
I forgot about the battle.
There's no part of that sentence I didn't like!
Hey, whatcha watching?
Oh, all right, I am.
But if anything happens to me, tell them I died robbing some old man.
Guards!
Bring me the forms I need to fill out to have her taken away!
When will that be?
It's a T.
It goes "tuh".
That could be 'my' beautiful soul sitting naked on a couch.
If I could just learn to play this stupid thing.
Leela's gonna kill me.
For example, if you killed your grandfather, you'd cease to exist!
Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets?
Hi, I'm a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to.
$9.95 a minute.
I didn't ask for a completely reasonable excuse!
I asked you to get busy!
Five hours?
Aw, man! Couldn't you just get me the death penalty?
Who said that?
SURE you can die!
You want to die?!
You, a bobsleder!?
That I'd like to see!
Yeah, lots of people did.
Now Fry, it's been a few years since medical school, so remind me.
Disemboweling in your species: fatal or non-fatal?
Bender?!
You stole the atom.
You know the worst thing about being a slave?
They make you work, but they don't pay you or let you go.
Anyhoo, your net-suits will allow you to experience Fry's worm infested bowels as if you were actually wriggling through them.
I love you, buddy!
You seem malnourished.
Are you suffering from intestinal parasites?
What are you hacking off?
Is it my torso?!
My precious torso!
Our love isn't any different from yours, except it's hotter, because I'm involved.
It's a T.
It goes "tuh".
I am Singing Wind, Chief of the Martians.
Shinier than yours, meatbag.
Whoa a real live robot; or is that some kind of cheesy New Year's costume?
I am the man with no name, Zapp Brannigan!
I guess because my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike.
As though!
In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up!
Besides, these are adult stemcells, harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stemcells.
No!
Don't jump!
I could if you hadn't turned on the light and shut off my stereo.
This is the worst kind of discrimination: the kind against me!
Hey, guess what you're accessories to.
Interesting.
No, wait, the other thing: tedious.
Whoa a real live robot; or is that some kind of cheesy New Year's costume?
Hey, tell me something.
You've got all this money.
How come you always dress like you're doing your laundry?
OK, this has gotta stop.
I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can.
I found what I need.
And it's not friends, it's things.
Ask her how her day was.
Your best is an idiot!
Hi, I'm a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to.
$9.95 a minute.
Bender, we're trying our best.
Alright, let's mafia things up a bit.
Joey, burn down the ship.
Clamps, burn down the crew.
I videotape every customer that comes in here, so that I may blackmail them later.
Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn't make sense.
But, okay!
Good news, everyone!
There's a report on TV with some very bad news!
Ok, we'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go ride the bumper cars.
Fry!
Quit doing the right thing, you jerk!
I videotape every customer that comes in here, so that I may blackmail them later.
Dear God, they'll be killed on our doorstep!
And there's no trash pickup until January 3rd.
Oh, how awful.
Did he at least die painlessly?
To shreds, you say.
Well, how is his wife holding up?
To shreds, you say.
In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust bosoms.
Ask her how her day was.
Hello Morbo, how's the family?
Tell her she looks thin.
Look, last night was a mistake.
You can see how I lived before I met you.
Kif might!
No!
Don't jump!
Guards!
Bring me the forms I need to fill out to have her taken away!
Ow, my spirit!
Fry, we have a crate to deliver.
Ah, computer dating.
It's like pimping, but you rarely have to use the phrase "upside your head."
Stop! Don't shoot fire stick in space canoe!
Cause explosive decompression!
Bender, quit destroying the universe!
Who am I making this out to? I can explain.
It's very valuable.
Yes, if you make it look like an electrical fire.
When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all.
Why did you bring us here?
So, how 'bout them Knicks?
Why am I sticky and naked?
Did I miss something fun?
Is that a cooking show?
A true inspiration for the children.
But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver.
I'm Santa Claus! But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver.
What kind of a father would I be if I said no?
Yes, if you make it look like an electrical fire.
When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all.
We can't compete with Mom!
Her company is big and evil!
Ours is small and neutral!
Hey, what kinda party is this?
There's no booze and only one hooker.
I'm sure those windmills will keep them cool.
Your best is an idiot!
They're like sex, except I'm having them!
I've been there.
My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants.
What am I, the pope?
Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock.
Good man.
Nixon's pro-war and pro-family.
This is the worst kind of discrimination: the kind against me!
You don't know how to do any of those.
Oh, I always feared he might run off like this.
Why, why, why didn't I break his legs?
Bender, I didn't know you liked cooking.
That's so cute.
Yes! In your face, Gandhi!
Oh dear!
She's stuck in an infinite loop, and he's an idiot!
Well, that's love for you.
I love this planet!
I've got wealth, fame, and access to the depths of sleaze that those things bring.
No, just a regular mistake.
Oh no!
The professor will hit me!
But if Zoidberg 'fixes' it… then perhaps gifts!
Noooooo!
WINDMILLS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY!
GOOD NIGHT!
Doomsday device?
Ah, now the ball's in Farnsworth's court!
If rubbin' frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey I don't wanna be right.
Kif, I have mated with a woman.
Inform the men.
Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged.
No argument here.
Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun!
Yeah, and if you were the pope they'd be all, "Straighten your pope hat."
And "Put on your good vestments."
Shut up and take my money!
WINDMILLS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY!
GOOD NIGHT!
Why yes!
Thanks for noticing.
I don't 'need' to drink.
I can quit anytime I want!
I could if you hadn't turned on the light and shut off my stereo.
Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn't make sense.
But, okay!
Yes. You gave me a dollar and some candy.
I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept the lesser title of Zinc Saucier, which I just made up.
Uhh… also, comes with double prize money.
Alright, let's mafia things up a bit.
Joey, burn down the ship.
Clamps, burn down the crew.
Ah, computer dating.
It's like pimping, but you rarely have to use the phrase "upside your head."
Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets?
Humans dating robots is sick. You people wonder why I'm still single?
It's 'cause all the fine robot sisters are dating humans!
The alien mothership is in orbit here.
If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards.
Checkmate.
Why did you bring us here? I can explain.
It's very valuable.
Alright, let's mafia things up a bit.
Joey, burn down the ship.
Clamps, burn down the crew.
Fry, we have a crate to deliver.
She also liked to shut up!
As an interesting side note, as a head without a body,
I envy the dead.
Who's brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere?
Noooooo!
I'm a thing.
